                <p>Hello! I&apos;m RÃ¼veyda Kartal, a passionate technology enthusiast and art appreciator. This project represents a fusion of my two interests. At the beginning, I wasn&apos;t sure if it would succeed, but I&apos;m delighted by the overwhelming interest and positivity it has received. My goal wasn&apos;t just to create something &apos;cool&apos; but also meaningful. I hope this project inspires you, that it is never wrong to speak your mind or show your creativity. It&apos;s what makes you, You. </p>
